# HoudiniPython_scripts
A collection of Python scripts that I use in Houdini for ease of work

# Pipe Merge Python Script
This script allows the user to create a null node and an object merge node that
has the path of the null in it's object_merge parameter. 

To use this script - 
1. Download the script.
2. Create a folder named "scripts" in your $HOME/houdini19.5/ (for linux) or C:\Users\user_name\Documents\Houdini19.5\ (for windows) (not sure about Mac, never used it)
3. Move the python script in your scripts folder.
4. Come out of the folder.
5. Download the OPmenu.xml file and place it here.

if everything goes right, it should look something like this -
